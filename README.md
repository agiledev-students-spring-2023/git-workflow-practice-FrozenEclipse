## What I found interesting
This article talks about a new site gaining traction called [layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/).  It tracks layoffs happening since the pandemic.  As a CS student planning to enter the job market, its of interest to me to be aware of hiring freezes and layoffs happening that could be due to an incoming recession.

I found this website extreemly helpful. I am also a CS student graduating in May and currently navigating the job market. I liked that the website was organized by companuy and locations where the layoffs were occuring. Though the website is a little scary as someone looking for a job it was also very interesting.
