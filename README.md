## What I found interesting
This article talks about a new site gaining traction called [layoffs.fyi](https://layoffs.fyi/).  It tracks layoffs happening since the pandemic.  As a CS student planning to enter the job market, its of interest to me to be aware of hiring freezes and layoffs happening that could be due to an incoming recession.
